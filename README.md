Project title:
Slanguage

About the App:
The team at Slanguage is passionate about learning languages! Our goal was to create a language app that had something most language apps are missingâ€¦ Slang. Lingo. Colloquialisms. In other words, the expressions you may not find in a dictionary or within the classroom. And for those language learners that do want the basics, Slanguage also offers other awesome categories to learn and practice with! 
Slanguage is meant for anyone that wants to pick up a new language and connect with people from all over the world! Learn, practice, check your progress, chat, have fun, repeat. Before you know it, you'll be speaking like a true local of the communities of your chosen language(s). Click on "My Dashboard" to get started learning some of the world's most spoken languages!

Build Status:
The app is functional right now, but for future development we would like to add more languages, a translation feature for the user to look up any word or phrase, a chat room for users to communicate and practice their language skills with people from all over the world and overall keep making the app better.




A language app for travelers that would like to learn the local slang.
